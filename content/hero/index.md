I'm a Final Year Computer Science and Engineering student at UM6P - Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Rabat, Morocco. I specialize in memory manipulation, Red Team operations, and defensive security, with a strong passion for Cyber Security and Hacking.

I enjoy learning new skills and implementing them in real life!
