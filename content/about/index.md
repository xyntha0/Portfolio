Hello! I'm Ilyas Mouhssin, a cybersecurity enthusiast and developer from Rabat, Morocco.

I specialize in memory manipulation, Red Team operations, and defensive security, always pushing the boundaries of ethical hacking and digital forensics. My passion for cybersecurity drives me to participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, where I sharpen my hacking skills and explore complex security vulnerabilities.

I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science and Engineering at UM6P - Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, focusing on Information Technology and Communication (ICTs).

Beyond cybersecurity, I enjoy art and creativity, whether through painting, crafting, or coding innovative security solutions. I believe that problem-solving is an art, and I apply that mindset to everything I do.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
