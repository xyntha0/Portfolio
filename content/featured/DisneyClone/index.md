Cynax Toolvam is basically a set of different classes, that collectively perform the function of toolkit. These functions include • A login function (To Achieve CIA). • A Cypher function that performs (Encryption & Decryption). • A Hash function (That calculates Hash of a message). • Strong Password Generator (Creates a Random Strong Password, as per users’ needs). • A firewall function (That Blocks or unblocks websites using file handling and file directory). Basic Idea for making such a program was, as students of CYS, we ought to implement the knowledge and skills of programming to make a relative program, and there we got the Idea of the toolvam. And as explained earlier, the functionality of program is not very complex, but it shows a strong relation to Cyber Security. Interface: The Interface of program is very simple, yet understanding and attractive, achieved using simple Do-While and If-else statements. The UI on the other hand is made using simple cout statements with the help of tab spaces and new line shortcuts. Interactive UI is the fundamental of a good program, and here we’ve achieved that using very simple and straight forward logic.
